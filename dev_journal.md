I'm going to document everything that arises so it's transparent 
with everyone who is going to look at this.

I'm trying to set up postgressql but I messed up and only set it locally in my pc at home, but I'm at my laptop at school. So to bypass this issue I'm going to use sqllite for now and then for tomorrow's focus I need to set up PostgresSQL for entire use everywhere.
