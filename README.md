# Open Source CRM Tool

A simple, full-stack, open-source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool built with Django, PostgreSQL, React, and Docker.

This project is part of my personal learning journey to deepen my skills in building scalable, real-world applications using the same tech stack used by modern SaaS companies.

## 🧠 Why I’m Building This

This project is **not a clone of any existing product**, but rather an original tool to explore:
- Django & PostgreSQL integration
- React frontend development
- API design with DRF
- Full-stack app architecture
- Docker-based dev environments

It’s a **learning-focused** build, but also a working example of how real SaaS apps are built from the ground up.
