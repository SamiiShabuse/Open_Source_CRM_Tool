I'm going to document everything that arises so it's transparent 
with everyone who is going to look at this.

I'm trying to set up postgressql but I messed up and only set it locally in my pc at home, but I'm at my laptop at school. So to bypass this issue I'm going to use sqllite for now and then for tomorrow's focus I need to set up PostgresSQL for entire use everywhere.

Right now I'm going to be really amazed to see how this new .github folder works. This is literally something new I'm learning right now and I'm already amazed by it.

Today is the day. I will be connecthing the frontend with the backend.

I'm going to make sure I learn how all this works hand-ons so it makes more sense to me.

Right now I'm just reading wht urls.py does in the `backend/core/urls.py`

I got it connect I literally forgot about the venv being necessary if I want anything to work.

Right now it's not working because I honestly forgot a lot about how the postgreSQL backend works haha...

psql -U your_username -d your_database
