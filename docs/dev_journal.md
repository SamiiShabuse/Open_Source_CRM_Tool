I'm going to document everything that arises so it's transparent 
with everyone who is going to look at this.

I'm trying to set up postgressql but I messed up and only set it locally in my pc at home, but I'm at my laptop at school. So to bypass this issue I'm going to use sqllite for now and then for tomorrow's focus I need to set up PostgresSQL for entire use everywhere.

Right now I'm going to be really amazed to see how this new .github folder works. This is literally something new I'm learning right now and I'm already amazed by it.

Today I'm focusing on installing kubernetes and whatever else importan processes I need to allow postgressql to work on both my laptop and computer.

I'm already learning a lot about how you can use the CLI version versus the GUI version to install this. 

There are a lot of different things as well in Kubernetes I didn't realize there is so many opportunities.

Now I'm reminicsing on how I could've gotten much father in development with the Kubernetes at my internship if I literally just asked how to do it, and just scheduled 15 minutes with someone. 

So I got kubectl and minikube installed and set up.

I'm going with the approach have two clusters each to have their own context.
